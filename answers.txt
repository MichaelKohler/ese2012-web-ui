Explain how a typical HTTP request is processed with the framework (the request lifecycle)
            The different routes are defined in the files in /controllers. They are splitted into
			different files for convenience. Based on the requested URL, different actions are
			performed in order to get important variables which are then passed into a view (defined
			in /views). All instance variable defined in the controller will be available to the view,
			which is then displayed.
     
    Why should GET requests be indempotent?
            After RFC 2616, 9.1.2: GET requests should only be used for retrieving information (hence
			"GET") and not to perform any action on the server that alters data or state, so the user/
			application can predict possible consequences. GET and HEAD are considered "safe" methods
			(in contrary to POST, PUT and DELETE). GETting a resource multiple times should have the
			same effect as GETting it once.
			This has the advantages that 1) browsers can prefetch pages without changing data, 2) bots
			and spiders may index the pages without altering data, 3) clients may cache content.
     
    Where should you format data for rendering?
            In a view, in order to separate the application logic from the presentation.
